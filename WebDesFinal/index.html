                    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Anna. As of 2024, I am a junior in computer science at Wright State University. I have also taken some computer classes at Sinclair. I created this page using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a final project for Web Development One. Thank you for visiting!</p>
                
                    <p>I have experience programming in many languages, but my favorites are Java, Rackett, and Python. I am also versed in virtual machines, cyber security, and platforms like AWS and PowerShell. Outside of Computer Science, I have also taken many classes in Deaf Studies and American Sign Language in my free time! </p>
            
                    <p>In the future, I hope to graduate and work in an area where I can use my skills to help other people. I have an interest in computational linguistics and would like to continue school to learn more about the subject and ultimately get a job working with both languages and computers. </p>
